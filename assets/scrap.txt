Use any of these identity providers to login and create an account.

If you would like other authentication options please let us know.

We use trusted third parties for authentication; this means you can use your existing Google, Microsoft Live (Hotmail) or Facebook accounts to login without having to create a new password.

Once you've created your account you can log migraines individually or upload a file containing lots of them from a Spreadsheet (.xsl, .csv) or Calendar file (.ics).
