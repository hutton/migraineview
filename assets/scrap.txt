I wanted a better way to log my Migraines so I built this.

I've been logging my migraines in Google Calendar for 5 years but I didn't really feel I was getting much out of it.  I wanted some sort of analysis on when attacks were happening; which days/times of year were most frequent, are they evenly spread out or all clustered together? etc.

So being a programmer I built a report to show this (you can see an example here http://migraine.report/example/report).  I've since build a website around this to let other people upload (from Google Calendar or a spreadsheet) their own migraines and log new ones.

I would love to hear what you think about it and especially any ideas you may have about insightful ways to display your migraine data.

Give it a try here http://migraine.report
