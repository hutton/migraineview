I wanted a better way to log my Migraines so I built this

I've been logging my migraines in Google Calendar for 5 years but I didn't really feel I was getting much out of it.  I wanted some sort of analysis on when attacks were happening; which days/times of year were most frequent, are they evenly spread out or all clustered together? etc.

So being a computer programmer I built a report to show this (you can see an example here <a href="http://migraine.report/example/report" title="http://migraine.report/example/report" rel="" target="">http://migraine.report/example/report</a>).  I've since build a website around this to let other people upload (from Google Calendar or a spreadsheet) their own migraines and log new ones.

I would love to hear what you think about it and especially any ideas you may have about insightful ways to display your migraine data.

(Turns out Monday's are my worst days and I've never had a migraine in February!)
